# RuLanAdCor
Russian Language Advertisement Corpus

Corpus is automatically extracted from, uh, Internets, from two sources for now: 
sites in [Yandex Catalog](yaca.yandex.ru) and Apple AppStore. All samples are 
publicly available, no problems should arise when using corpus for research
purposes, but investigate license question a bit more if you are a rotten 
capitalist.

Final corpus can be obtained by running **generate-corpus.sh**. Or you can run 
separate scripts:

* **crawl.py** - collects urls from Yandex Catalog.
* **process-appstore.py** - extracts samples from Apple AppStore
* **process-yaca.py** - extracts samples from list of urls. If file is supplied 
as argument, takes urls from it, otherwise crawls urls from YaCa.
* **join.py** - joins text files generated by **process-*** scripts into one xml
corpus.

You'll need [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) and [selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/)
to process YaCa.
